# rrmxmx for Kotlin-multiplatform

This project implements rrmxmx as proposed by [Pelle Evensen](http://mostlymangling.blogspot.com/2018/07/on-mixing-functions-in-fast-splittable.html):
a very fast hashing function that performs very well with low-entropy input data
(e.g., a sequence of constantly-incrementing numbers).
